In Preschool, childrenâ€™s little hands and fingers are not ready to hold a pencil and write. Instead they enjoy experimenting with lines, shapes and scribbles. We provide the opportunity to exercise those small muscles through coloring, cutting, painting, lacing, gluing, tracing, clay play, etc. These activities are not only enjoyable; but also helpful in strengthening a correct grip and control of their fingers, and hand/eye coordination.
