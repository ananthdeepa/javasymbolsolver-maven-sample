In Preschool, children’s little hands and fingers are not ready to hold a pencil and write. Instead they enjoy experimenting with lines, shapes and scribbles. We provide the opportunity to exercise those small muscles through coloring, cutting, painting, lacing, gluing, tracing, clay play, etc. These activities are not only enjoyable; but also helpful in strengthening a correct grip and control of their fingers, and hand/eye coordination. 
Even though small muscle development continues in fours, they are enjoying their ability to better control their markers, crayons, scissors, and paint brushes. Soon the children receive a large tri-sided pencil giving them the opportunity to trace the alphabet, numbers, and their names
By kindergarten, the children’s hand/eye coordination and pencil grip are vastly improved and ready to take on the challenges of writing. We provide ample opportunity to practice in our special writing tablet made just for their size. Before you know it, they will be writing sentences.
